\section{Tables}\label{sec:appendix_tables}
Following the practice from \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1709-06560}
and \citet{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1904.06979}, Welch's
\textit{t}-test was used to test whether each ensemble variant of the
analyzed algorithms performed worse than its respective base version
in terms of the defined response metrics.
For the Ensemble-DQV-Max ablations experiment, a Kruskal-Wallis H-test
was used to compare the former agent to its ablated variants.
Both test were performed with the corresponding routines from the
\texttt{SciPy} Python package \citep{2020SciPy-NMeth}.

TODO insert comparisons table, resize it is too large to fit on one
column just like the example below

REVIEW should p-values table be included too? maybe asterisks or
coloring the cell in the raw values table is enough
