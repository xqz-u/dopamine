\section{Appendices}\label{ap:appendices}
If you have more than one Appendix, use letters to ‘‘number” them. You may start every appendix on a new page, but this is not necessary. If you have many appendices, it may be helpful for the reader to have a list of appendices on the first page of the appendices.
